Random Placement Solution:  ['g8', 'c7', 'h6', 'b5', 'e4', 'a3', 'f2', 'd1']

This proves that the systematic_backtracking (systematically, with backtracking) algorithm is much faster than the heuristic_random_placement (randomly assigned) algorithm. However, it should be noted that, since random placement occurs, sometimes the algorithm may be faster, but that is rare.
