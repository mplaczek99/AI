The heuristic_random_placement algorithm had a different outcome each time it was ran. Sometimes high, sometimes low. The systematic_backtracking algorithm had a consistent outcome of 2438 operations performed each time.

This proves that (usually) the heuristic_random_placement algorithm is worse than the systematic_backtracking one.
